- ja_git_push_back_v2.sh
    - used to auto push back for your current branch (save time purpose)
- ja_github_auto_creer_nouvelle_grpc_template_repo.sh
    - used to create new branch:
    - sop
        - put the ooo.sh to your path
        - source ooo.sh
        - type new_branch_name
        - this will automatically clone the master (basic file) to new_branch_name
    - I used this to seperate different branch with different type of tech. structure.
